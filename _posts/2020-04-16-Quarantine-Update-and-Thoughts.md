31 days ago quarantine began. It's not really quarantine. It's a tentative shelter-in-place order, an alternate reality where isolation and mistrust hang thick in the air. March crawled but April has been a blur. I figure it's time to write. Let's see where this goes.

My last writing was on Day 13. Looking over the post, I see I was reading Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. I'm still reading it. To sum without spoiling, it's poignant. I just finished the August article and it feels roughly where we are now in April, days after Bernie suspended his campaign. 

I'll spare you from my opinion on that topic. Needless to say, I am displeased.

The reading is happening under some great weather. Back in March, I had joked that April would be the rainiest April on record. It rained the first day or so, but has been mostly calm sunshine since then. The yard was growing wild with weeds, tall and dark green. My roommate and I agreed that we enjoyed it; the local plants thriving on the edges of the yard with the interior a patchy, suburban grass. 

The weeds had to go, eventually. The yard has been cut, trimmed back to respectable levels. We will be planting a garden soon, an attempt to grow food for ourselves. Like the yard, I, too, have trimmed. I have been working on something called a “beard” for a number of months now. I’ve kept it trimmed along the way, keeping it from growing wildly but allowing it to grow. 

It’s a scam. The color isn’t right and it’s still too patchy. So it’s gone. Underneath was hiding a slimmer face, younger, reminding me of past mirrors and memories. At least I get to use my razors and brush. The old-school style of shaving, used a century ago, is a careful and pleasant grooming experience. Lathering a good soap to a fluff and running a sharp razor for the result you want. There’s something about it.

The update on my cooking is less incremental. Today I made myself French toast, bacon, and scrambled eggs. Simple enough, but the real celebration is in the fact that I made it all at once. My biggest hesitation to *really* cook is the management of all the different parts of a meal. 

I have also upgraded my ramen game. There’s a whole egg involved and multiple steps with boiling water. Lots of seasoning. It’s delicious and I’m eating it, like, every other day. 

I made brownies the other day. They are delicious, as expected. I vacuum sealed them so I could deliver them to friends. 

We have grabbed take-out a few times now. Mexican food (absolutely delicious, and my dinner tonight again) and pizza twice. It’s interesting. Some places have you come in still and the employees are mask-free. Other places allow nobody inside except employees, and they deliver the food to the car wearing a mask and gloves. 

Grocery stores, too, vary wildly. A trip to a small, East Asian market resulted in every person, employee and customer, wearing a mask. But the larger, more Caucasian the stores grow, the less common masks become. Even now, at Target, many employees are without a mask or gloves, stocking items and standing close. 

I have spent a lot of time playing Xbox. At first, it was Rocket League but I’ve shifted to Call of Duty: Warzone. It’s a battle royale style game. It’s the fourth or fifth one I’ve played and it’s my favorite. I’ve played for hours a day. *Hours*. And deep into the night, too. This is turning into an extended Spring Break.

I’m running out of steam already. This feels like a useless update. I’ve been working on some deeper writings but those are, of course, incomplete. I need to outline better. The last thing I outlined became a 20-page, detailed writing on a dwarf society I created for my D&D campaign.
