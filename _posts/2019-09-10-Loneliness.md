I really have no objective with this post but, I guess, to express some pretty unpleasant feelings and to organize my thoughts. For much of this year I have considered myself a bachelor, in a lazy sense of the word, but those feelings have been steadily transforming into loneliness. A loneliness fed by a lack of a meaningful connection with someone I can grow and change with. A loneliness looming large days before I depart on a week-long solo trip to another country, thousands of miles of away from home. :)

Loneliness, accompanied by [a few definitions from Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lonely), is a very pervasive feeling. It is an emotion which drives your decision-making, like maybe holding your roommate’s cuddly dog hostage for a day (or three. Thankfully, I have wonderful friends who have helped me shoulder this over the last few days, but it’s all temporary. Like I said before, this is a solitude realized “by a lack of a meaningful connection with someone I can grow and change with.” I love my friends and I find them to be great people. However, none of these relationships are like the one I am referring to. In other words, have you ever spent hours around friends yet still felt as alone as ever?

Just putting these words down on a screen has been helpful. See, that’s part of the issue. Loneliness is a bottle within which you find yourself stuffed. It’s hard to express this kind of sadness in the moment, making print a more deliberate, meaningful expression. On the other hand…

Loneliness is common, of this I have no doubt. But how is that comforting? It’s not like I, or anyone else, is asking for the world to line up and shake hands. I am simply feeling the gap where a partner would go. This is where Japan comes up.

A week from today, I depart to go to Tokyo. I’ll be spending time there and in Kyoto, surrounded but alone. I have a few tabs open for some AirBnb experiences, though, so I’m not, like, sitting here anxiously. There are obviously things you can do to address loneliness. But I must admit that I am not looking forward to being without my friends in a new place for a week. I will enjoy it once I’m there and I’m sure when I come back home it will be an exciting thing to talk about. But I’m not there, enjoying the post-vacation glow. I’m here, before the trip, staring down the barrel of a week of a week-long isolation. It’s the classic and cliche head versus heart.

Which leads me to [my last post]({% 2019-09-02-Dating and like Stuff %}) where I specifically “question my own motives” when it comes to dating. So, somehow, my conclusion to this entire dilemma is that I should probably stop dating until I sort out my selfish feelings. That begs the question, how will I fill this gap where a meaningful relationship would be?

It’s simple. I don’t. I guess.

I think I’m running out of steam here. Maybe I’ll come back and add to this.
