Well, then.

In January, President Trump almost led us into a war with Iran. 

Also, Australia was on fire.

Today, I received word from my employer that I would be put on furlough on Monday. No income and no health insurance as COVID-19 starts rearing its head on America. In my opinion (isn't all of this?), the federal government has absolutely failed us. Not just in recent days and weeks, but in recent decades. America is wholly unprepared, at every level from the leadership to the states to the individuals. This is unprecedented. The last time the world faced a pandemic on this scale was 1918. 

I honestly don't have much to write. Losing my income hurts. I'm going to try to pick up work at the North Texas Food Bank or some grocer. I'm also going to try to ride down the stock market with some bear funds but the White House is focused on pumping the market up. Priorities are misdirected and individuals are very anxious. This will be interesting.
