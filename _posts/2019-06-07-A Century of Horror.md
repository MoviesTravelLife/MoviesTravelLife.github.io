I am starting a little bit of a journey to learn more about the horror genre of film. The goal of this project is to go back to the origins of film itself and see how the horror movie has changed over the last 120 years. 

I have 41 films selected, which you can see listed in order below.

41. [Cabin In The Woods (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521)

I will be breaking up the 41 films into five groups, each marking what I consider to be an important period in film. We start with the short films, dominated by Georgies Melies and his trick films. From there, movie length explodes and we see our first full length feature films. After that comes audio, and the first significant time sink in this project. When color is introduced, I break up the periods with the Cold War because it's easy. Between these two periods, I see Cold War Color as developing and furthering the horror genre, getting us to Contemporary Horror.

| Time Period | Count of Films | Total Runtime | Average Runtime |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Silent Shorts | 11 | 1:40:00 | 0:09:05 |
| The Beginning of the Features | 4 | 5:46:00 | 1:26:30 |
| Black & White Talkies | 10 | 13:02:00 | 1:18:12 |
| Cold War Color | 9 | 15:53:00 | 1:45:53 |
| Contemporary Horror | 7 | 11:24:00 | 1:37:43 |

I haven’t seen any of these except the last film I’ll watch, which is a meta-analysis of the genre itself. Besides Cabin in the Woods, I will be watching every film in order of release year, touching some of the highlights like the first horror feature, the first horror feature with audio, and the first horror feature with color. There are a number of classics as well, covering the popularity spectrum from classic blockbusters to the heights of obscurity. 

I will do my best to keep an eye out for a few things that have consistently been a part of films since the inception of the medium:

* Plot Complexity
* Set Design
* Camera Work

I will probably come back and add a few more things to this list.

For furthering my education, I have been recommended the following items:

* [History of Horror](https://www.shudder.com/series/watch/amc-visionaries-eli-roths-history-of-horror/4704999) by Eli Roth
* [A History of Horror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1738321/) by Mark Gatiss
* [Horror Europa](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2497226/) by Mark Gatiss

With that, I will be back after I watch the first 12 films!
