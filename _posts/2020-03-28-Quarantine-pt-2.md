I must be honest and lead the front with a fact: it is hard to keep track of the days. Today is Saturday, March 28, 2020. That makes it day 13 of my quarantine. Things have...developed. To see and experience the effects of exponential growth is quite _something_.

I'm selecting March 16 as the first of quarantine _(my true love gave to me...)_ because it is the first day I worked from home indefinitely. Turns out indefinitely meant five days. I was placed on furlough at the beginning of this week. Unemployment claims are something like three times higher than the 2009-2010 crash. Like everybody else, my health insurance is tied to my employment. Due to a probationary period policy, I have received no health insurance in this time and will have to go into debt to afford it during this pandemic. But the good news is that I have been approved for unemployment which should be enough to keep me afloat for the next six months. 

Congress and the President have passed a stimulus bill worth two trillion dollars while the Federal Reserve has said that they will basically print money until the markets stabilize. Last week with the stroke of a pen, the stock markets got over two trillion dollars. This week, between lazy fights and authoritarian actions (Democrats hardly put up a fight and ICE is still making raids and deporting people), the stimulus bill gives one and a half of those trillions to business. Individual citizens can get up to $1,200 each. More if you have kids. Nothing if you're a student or recent graduate.

These brazen capital-protecting moves have absorbed the focus of the federal government while hospitals beg for equipment. Governors and mayors have said that they have been out-bid by the federal government, who is also sitting on unused equipment. The President has demanded that governors requesting support show "gratitude" and "be nice" and other praises for a narcissistic toddler.

Anyway. All that to say, it’s brazenly clear given the recents of the last couple of decades why the youngest generations have lost faith in their elders and their government. Leading us into a costly imperialist war based on lies, we have thrown trillions into destabilizing the Middle East and causing enough mayhem to create a generation of anti-American extremists. This is yet another American war where the government, regardless of the so-called political “party” in control, acts in stark defiance of the wishes of the American people. Rampaging on the ground and expanding operations into operating countries, the Forever Wars have moved from east Asia to the cradle of civilization. 

Meanwhile, nations wage war through surveillance, corruption, politics, economics, and business. Funding rivals in all spheres whilst defending your territory at home develops a sharp sense of paranoia among the politically-inclined. Focusing on these things is why so many countries missed the virus and acted poorly despite time and pleas. Italy was caught off-guard while Hong Kong implemented social distancing, masks, and testing (both in COVID-19 tests and even body temperature tests) in December at the first sign of trouble in Wuhan. Korea had an unlucky case. The first 36-or-so infected persons distanced themselves and minimized their spread. But number 38, I think, ignored warnings and went to a religious service. 

From there, the virus exploded. Happier topics are coming, but stay with me.

The Korean government remembered SARS from 2004. They increased testing to drive-thru centers and were testing something like 23,000 people a day, last I heard. They were testing 10,000 people a day before the United States even hit 10,000 tests. 

Right now, the United States is showing [124,471](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/) cases and 5,655 deaths with 19,562 new cases. On March 19th, the last time I posted, our numbers were 14,095 cases, 208 deaths, and 5,424 new cases. 

That’s exponential growth. Trump wants to remove social distancing guidelines Easter weekend. 

Right.

Okay.

Good luck with that.

It is time for the good things. Really, the only good thing I have in mind at the moment is the memes. The quality of our shared humor has latched onto the rise of global anxiety, bringing us undoubtedly the best version of memes. 

I’m too lazy to share any, though. How do you pick one or two or several? It would be an injustice to a hundred better memes, or the ones that will come out in two days, or two days after those. 

Ten years ago, in the depths of the Great Recession, … well, I will admit that I don’t remember any specific memes from that time. So I did a quick Google search and found [this from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/the-12-best-worst-memes-of-2010/68479/), published the day before Christmas Eve in 2010. I remember several of these. I also just learned that the popular Sad Keanu meme from this past year was not new.

Anyway, those memes are _okay_, at best. And we’re only in the third month of this godawful year. 

I have also been reading more. Not quite a chapter a day but I’m banging through [Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail ‘72 by Hunter S. Thompson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7748.Fear_and_Loathing_on_the_Campaign_Trail_72). His once- or twice-monthly articles through the primary and general election seasons of Nixon’s incumbent campaign tell stories from dingy motels and glad-handing candidates in a political landscape not too different from our own. I am somewhere in the month of June, mostly reading outside in the wonderful, gleaming sun. 

I wonder what HST would be saying today.

I’m putting quite the strain on my immune system, though. My allergies have raged the last couple of days. I’m taking my temperature multiple times a day to keep on top of potential symptoms, though. 

I have been cooking, also. The variety of food is a good reflection of our pandemic feelings. In order, my roommate and I have cooked:

Peanut butter and chocolate chip waffles and Chick-Fil-A-ish chicken nuggets (we got excited)
Baked potatoes
Dalgona coffee
Korean BBQ/bulgogi beef

What I mean by “pandemic feelings” is this pervasive sense of uncertainty. We’re all working to stay afloat, but a lot of us are doing so by flailing. Frankly, we don’t know what direction is the right one to follow; so we try a little bit of everything and see what sticks. 

America’s panic has emptied the shelves of stores, a sight never before seen for millions. 

And we’re still in the early days. The reality isn’t quite _real_ for a lot of people. There are voices in the media saying that the economy cannot stop for a pandemic. Politicians, such as Texas’ own Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, have argued that it is “noble” that consumers would die so that the economy keeps moving. Appalling. To be met with such disdain in the face of supply chain challenges for everyday basic needs is our bald-face version of “let them eat cake.”

My laptop battery is almost dead. Keep watching good movies and wash your hands.
