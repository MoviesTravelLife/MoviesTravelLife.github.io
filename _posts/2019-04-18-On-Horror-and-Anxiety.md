In [my previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-16-Horror-pt-1 %}), I discuss how watching Horror movies has helped me overcome some anxiety in recent weeks. Today, I saw this Reddit thread: [Does anyone else find horror movies comforting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/bec5es/does_anyone_else_find_horror_movies_comforting/) One of the comments in that thread links to the following article.

### [Why Some Anxious People Find Comfort in Horror Movies](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/a3wdzk/why-some-anxious-people-find-comfort-in-horror-movies)

>It may not make sense, but some people with anxiety disorders–myself included—love nothing more than calming down with a terrifying film. I talked to researchers to find out why.

I found this article somewhat enlightening and interesting. Some of it *feels* familiar to me, even though I had not considered or discussed it. Specifically, the feeling of getting used to the anxiety and realizing that the situation is not really as bad as I think it is.
