Fall has just started (allegedly) and October greets us at midnight. I am, of course, starting another project yet I have made no progress on [my last project]({% post_url 2019-06-07-A-Century-of-Horror %}). Because I am me and that is a thing that I do regularly. Lets dive into what I have in store.

Spooktober is what I am calling this project. The goal is to watch one horror movie per day. This will be a challenge as I have a work trip coming up but I will be happy if I can score one movie *on average* per day. I have done a similar project in the past, where I simply watched one movie per day. I averaged something like 1.6 movies per day and it was certainly draining. 

Another thing to note is that all the movies listed on my project A Century of Horror do not appear in this list. I am keeping the two lists separate. That said, I won't be restricting myself to this list of 135 movies. If I stumble on something on Prime Video (very likely) then I am leaving the door open for that. 

I must admit, though. I am not confident that I can pull this off. I may have to split movies up where I start them after work and then finish them after what I have planned for the night. We will see what happens.

This idea and a lot of these movies have been sourced from Reddit. Lets get to the list which I have sorted from oldest to newest.

135. [The Cloverfield Paradox (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2548396)

Many of these I've seen this year or previously, and many I haven't seen at all. Some initial stats about these movies:

Of the 135, 4 (3%) are not in English. The 4 are split between Japanese and Spanish, each with 2 movies. There is certainly a bias for modern movies, but I tried to give myself a wide variety of options, from the early days of films to some more modern classics.

![Spooktober Decades](/imagines/Spooktober Decades.png)

So far this year, I have watched 100 films, five of them two times each for a total of 105 viewings. 32 of those have been sorted as Horror on IMDb. My movie viewing has decreased in recent months as I've put a lot more time into dating and television shows and life in general. 

![Count of Movie Viewings, YTD September 2019](/images/Count of Viewings Per Month.png)

If I hit this goal I will have seen *at least* one movie per day, making October my month with the most activity (up 72% from 18-movies April). 

There are some numbers and movies for you. I will be back with an update of some kind eventually!
