title: Horror, pt. 1
---

As of today, April 16th, 2019, I have put an entire 79 hours and 16 minutes into movies so far this year. That's over three solid days of cinema goodness, almost an average of one day per month. I've been watching a variety of things from [His Girl Friday (1940)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032599/) to [The Battery (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2272350/) to [Us (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6857112/). In this post, I am going to dive in to the horror genre, easily my favorite of them all. I expect this will be an ongoing series for a variety of reasons, some of which I will discuss in this post.

## First, Some Numbers

The first thing I should point out is just how much horror I have watched lately. Of the 42 movies I've seen so far, 12 (29% of the overall) are categorized as Horror by IMDb. 17 (40% of the overall) are labeled as Thriller and 9 (21%) are listed both as Horror and Thriller. Horror is tied for the fourth most viewed genre, behind Thriller (17 counts), Action (15 counts), and Adventure and Sci-Fi (13 counts each). The other genre in fourth place is Drama. If you take out Marvel, then you can drop Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi by 6 counts each, moving Horror up to being tied for second. Yes, I have watched 6 MCU movies so far this year. This does not include any [Black Christmas](https://www.netflix.com/title/80198988), [Slasher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4667888/), [Chilling Adventures of Sabrina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7569592/), or [Z Nation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3843168/) as I do not track shows in any capacity.

One more statistic before I really get into this. Of the 79:16:00 (79 hours and 16 minutes) I've sunk into movies so far, 20:41:00 (26%) have gone into Horror. The average runtime for a Horror is just under 10 minutes compared to all of the 42 movies I have experienced (1:53:14 compared to Horrors 1:43:25 and a 1:57:10 average for everything *except* Horror). That's half a work week already, and it's not even May.

## Some Background

As for what inspired this post, you will recall that I have seen 12 movies labeled Horror this year. Six of those came within the last 14 days, eight if you stretch it to 20 days. The other four came between in a 44 day period earlier this year. From one movie per 11 days to one movie per 2.3 days between those two stretches, my average time between Horror movies is just over one week for the year. So what's with the uptick?

For this, I give the credit to Jordan Peele. Unfortunately, I cannot find the Dreaddit thread that inspired the selections I am about to discuss, but basically, Jordan Peele gave the cast of Us some homework. He listed [these 10 films](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2018/12/31/jordan-peele-had-the-cast-of-us-watch-these-horror-films/), half of which I've already seen in my lifetime (and none this year). The aforementioned thread on Reddit had several more movies listed, all considered important for the genre to varying degrees. Halloween (1978) and The Last House On The Left (1972) were in that thread. I decided that I should finally gain some appreciation for the inspiration for much of modern horror and emerged from a Horror hibernation to watch Halloween the day before I saw Us. 

That's only one movie, but the idea stuck with me. On April 2nd, I was *supposed* to fly to Vietnam. Due to some inefficient policies (my opinion) from Korean Air, I was not able to make my trip. I spent the rest of that day as well as the next day moping at home, taking some time to myself to feel the disappointment of my second cancelled trip this year. On the 3rd, while off work, I watched the original The Last House on the Left. And this sparked the recent binge, watching five more Horrors in the following 11 days. 

From there I went with movies I know and enjoy, specifically A Quiet Place and Get Out. The Meg, in my opinion, is a bit of an anomaly, but it does fit the most common definition of Horror that I see (an element of the supernatural; in this case, a prehistoric massive shark). After that came both versions of Suspiria. More on that in a minute.

## The Real Why

So why? Why the uptick, why all these numbers, and why does it matter in the first place?

Horror has long relied on emotions that are considered negative such as fear, anxiety, and violence. From the macro scale of a culture and making social commentarty all the way down to scaring little kids, Horror has been the conduit with which together we experience tension.
